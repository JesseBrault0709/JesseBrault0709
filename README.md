# Jesse Brault: Programmer, Musician

![Jesse Brault Hero Photograph](images/JesseBraultHeaderNoTextMin.jpg)

**Welcome! I am a full-stack developer currently looking for work in Berlin, Germany.** I began my career as a classically-trained conductor and composer, and am transitioning to software development full-time. I love programming, learning new languages and frameworks, and developing interesting and exciting projects.

My programming interests lie in programming languages themselves (including grammars, lexers, parsers, ASTs, compilation, transpilation, etc.), web and app development (full-stack, including Spring, Node, and React), programming tools and plugins (Gradle and IntelliJ plugins), and functional programming. I have limited experience with PHP, graphics/game programming, and some systems programming in C/C++.

Overall, I aim to be highly versatile and adept at adopting new technologies. I seek every day to hone my craft and become a better developer. I enjoy the logical and linguistic nature of software, and that sweet feeling When Things Just Work™️. I also enjoy the collaborative process of bringing new ideas and designs to life.

## Current Projects

### JVM: Java and Groovy
- [**groowt**, or **Groovy Web Tools**](https://github.com/JesseBrault0709/groowt): A set of libraries, CLI tools, and Gradle plugins written mostly in Java for facilitating web-development in Groovy, emphasizing the model-view-controller paradigm. Includes a custom templating language inspired by ReactJS, with a compiler developed with the ANTLR parser generator. 2024 *(in progress)*.
- [**ssg**, or **Static Site Generator**](https://github.com/JesseBrault0709/ssg): A highly-extensible CLI application written entirely in Groovy for statically generating websites from text files and other input. I created this out of a need for a static site generator in which I could embed Groovy without all the hassle of a full-size server-oriented framework such as Grails. So far, I am using it for all my personal sites, and it has also been used outside of my own projects. 2023.
- [**jbarchiva**](https://github.com/JesseBrault0709/jbarchiva): A Gradle plugin to facilitate easy access to my personal Maven repository at [archiva.jessebrault.com](https://archiva.jessebrault.com/). 2022-2024.

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- [**jbci**, or **Jesse Brault Continuous Integration**](https://github.com/JesseBrault0709/jbci): A CI program written in TypeScript which listens to GitHub webhooks and then executes pre-configured shell scripts based on the webhook payload, mainly used to update my websites by simple pushes to my various GitHub repositories.
- [**jb-api**](https://github.com/JesseBrault0709/jb-api): A very simple utility backend written in TypeScript for my personal websites. Currently its only function is to recieve and handle mail requests (such as from a contact form).
  
### Web Sites
- [Red Dog Ensemble](https://github.com/JesseBrault0709/reddog): A web site for a contemporary classical music ensemble I am co-founding in New York City. <a href="https://reddogensemble.com/" target="_blank">Visit site.</a>
- [Personal Website](https://github.com/JesseBrault0709/temp-website): A temporary version of my personal web site where I plan to store my classical-music related portfolios, biography, and other information. <a href="https://jessebrault.com/" target="_blank">Visit site.</a>

## Past Projects

- [**Meals Made Easy**](https://github.com/JesseBrault0709/MealsMadeEasy): A fully-functioning meal-planning web-app developed during my time in _Co.Lab | You Belong in Tech_. I worked closely with a product manager and designer to make the project come alive! It is built with TypeScript, React, and SCSS.

I am most fluent with Java, Groovy, and Typescript. I am also fluent with standard web technologies such as HTML5, CSS, and sass; the type-setting technologies TeX and LaTex; and the scripting languages Ruby and Lua.
